# book_collection
This site was created for the front end class with code Louisville.
Welcome to my Book Collection site. I am happy you stopped by. Here is the skinny: This is viewable on a large screen and on tablets. Go ahead test it out. If you click on one of the gray buttons below What Books do you have? You can filter through the various books by Author. I plan to make a different version of this site this is more a starting point as my wife Katlin has waited for this site for five years. Let the fun begin!
I have a second css sheet nav.css that will download that is for the second phase of the site.
The only special thing you need to know is to click on the show all button to show all books and then each author for each author.
